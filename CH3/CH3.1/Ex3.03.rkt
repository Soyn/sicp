;; @Brief:Modify the make-account procedure so that it creates password-protected accounts.
;; That is, make-account should take a symbol as an additional argument, as in

;; (define acc (make-account 100 'secret-password))

;; The resulting account object should process a request only if it is accompanied by the password with
;; which the account was created, and should otherwise return a complaint:
;; ((acc 'secret-password 'withdraw) 40)
;; 60
;; ((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
;; "Incorrect password"

( define ( make-account balance password)
   ( define ( withdraw amount)
      ( if ( >= balance amount) ( begin ( set! balance ( - balance amount)) balance)
                                       "Insufficient funds"))
      ( define ( deposit amount)
         ( set! balance ( + balance amount)) balance)
      ( define ( dispatch p m)
         ( cond ( ( not ( eq? p password)) ( lambda(x) "Incorrect password"))
               ( ( eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
               ( ( eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
               ( else ( error "Unknown request --MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
      dispatch)

;; test

( define acc ( make-account 100 'secret))
(( acc 'secret 'withdraw) 40)
(( acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)

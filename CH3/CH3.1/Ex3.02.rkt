;; @Brief:In software-testing applications, it is useful to be able to count the number of times a given
;; procedure is called during the course of a computation. Write a procedure make-monitored that takes
;; as input a procedure, f, that itself takes one input. The result returned by make-monitored is a third
;; procedure, say mf, that keeps track of the number of times it has been called by maintaining an internal
;; counter. If the input to mf is the special symbol how-many-calls?, then mf returns the value of the
;; counter. If the input is the special symbol reset-count, then mf resets the counter to zero. For any
;; other input, mf returns the result of calling f on that input and increments the counter. For instance, we
;; could make a monitored version of the sqrt procedure:
;;        (define s (make-monitored sqrt))
;;        (s 100)
;;        10
;;        (s 'how-many-calls?)
;;        1

(define (make-monitored proc)
  ( let ( ( count 0))
     ( lambda (arg)
     ( cond (( eq? arg 'how-many-calls?) count)
           ( ( eq? arg 'reset-count) ( set! count 0))
           (else ( begin ( set! count ( + count 1))
                        ( proc arg)))))))


;; test

( define s ( make-monitored sqrt))
(s 100)
(s 'how-many-calls?)
